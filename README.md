Data visualisation is an important skill to possess for anyone trying to extract and communicate insights from data. 
Great business narratives and presentations often stem from brilliant visualisations that convey the key ideas in a concise and aesthetic manner. 
In the field of machine learning, visualisation plays a key role throughout the entire process of analysis - to obtain relationships, observe trends and portray the final results as well. 
Data visualisation is a crucial step in the process of data analysis

## The Necessity of Data Visualisation
It is essential to appreciate why it is so important to ‘look’ at the data from the perspective of plots and graphs. 
To begin with, it is difficult for the human eye to decipher patterns from raw numbers only. 
Sometimes, even the statistical information summarised from the data may mislead you to wrong conclusions. 
Therefore, you should visualise the data often to understand how different features are behaving. Data Visualization helps us understand flows and structures in an intuitive way.
